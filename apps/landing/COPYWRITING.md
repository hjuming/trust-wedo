## Problem Section
**Tired of "AI Slop"?**
Most AI coding tools generate code that *looks* right but fails in production. You spend more time debugging the AI than you would have spent writing it yourself.

## Features (The 4 Pillars)

### 1. Self-Verification Loop 🔄
We don't just "hope" it works. Every task includes automated unit and integration tests. If the tests don't pass, the agent keeps working until they do.

### 2. Deep Context Awareness 🧠
We index your entire repository—including READMEs, engineering decisions, and existing patterns. Your agent understands the *why* behind your code, not just the *what*.

### 3. End-to-End Autonomy 🚀
From scaffolding a new project to refactoring legacy modules and creating pull requests. Trust WEDO handles the multi-step workflows that stop other AIs in their tracks.

### 4. Security & Compliance 🛡️
Every change is scanned for vulnerabilities and secrets. We ensure your code follows best practices and stays compliant with your project standards.

## How It Works (3 Steps)
1. **Define your task:** Describe what you need in plain English or via CLI.
2. **Agent Executes:** The agent plans, implements, and tests the solution autonomously.
3. **Review & Merge:** Receive a PR with a full report and passing test logs.
